## Visual Studio Extensions
I've been toying around with some Visual Studio (Code) extensions lately. Here are some of my findings:

### Atlassian (Jira & Bitbucket) for VS-Code
The official Atlassian [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Atlassian.atlascode) to use with Jira & Bitbucket is a great little helper if you want to keep track of your Jira issues and Bitbucket repos, pull requests and last but definitely not least pipelines. Especially the pipelines part came in handy lately when i implemented a CI/CD workflow in a customer's Atlassian environment.

### Codestream
If you are using Jira/Bitbucket and Visual Studio (not Code) you will sonn realize that there is no official Atlassian extension for that specific setup. [Codestream](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream-vs) fills that void quite nice though. Besides managing issues (Jira) and pull requests (Bitbucket) this extension has a lot more to offer like integrations for Github/Gitlab, Teams and Slack. The main features which evolve around code discussions & feedback, i didn't even get to test yet. Definitely something i will check out in the future though.

### Github Copilot
I have to admit i was very skeptical about the usefulness of [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) for my needs. I enabled it once in Github for the trial period, forgot about it and was extremely surprised when Copilot kicked in with suggestions in a powershell script i created lately. The suggestioins were really really fitting for my case, it was kinda scary though how fast Copilot knew what i was about to create there.
