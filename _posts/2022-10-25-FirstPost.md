# FIRST ...

... blog post here at my Github page :champagne:

<sub>_(this post is a test run mainly)_</sub>

## Powershell module 'Add-AzFirewallRule' released

But there is also some real bit of news: I published a Powershell module to PS-Gallery earlier this day, that fellow Azure data engineers might find convenient to use. It automates the creation (or update) of firewall rules to all Azure Synapse workspaces and Azure Sql-Servers in a resource group. This was the outcome of manually adding my (dynamic) home office IP address on several environments on a daily basis (and the frustration that came along with that).  

Find more info in the [repository](https://github.com/brain246/azure-firewall-rule), or install it from [Powershell-Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Add-AzFirewallRule). 

Feedback, donations or presents of any kind are welcome.
