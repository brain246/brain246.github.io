# Me, myself and I

Hi there and welcome to my secret hideout[^blog] :wave:

I am Thomas and currently occupied as an (Azure) data engineer at [Capgemini Austria](https://www.capgemini.com/at-de/).

## Hot Topics & Interests

Not very surpsingly, my main focus is on all things data. More specifically, that currently means:

- Databricks, Spark & Delta
- Synapse (Serverless & Dedicated[^dedic], Spark, Data Explorer/Kusto, ...)
- Fabric
- Data Pipelines (Synapse & Data Factory)
- SQL-Servers (of any kind)
- Datalakehouses
- Streaming (data, not movies...)
- Restful APIs & GraphQL
- Cloud Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Bicep)

After 18 years of data warehousing, i am now pushing lakehouse architectures and the idea of a unified data platform. Besides signing the [DataOps Manifesto](https://dataopsmanifesto.org/), i am also a supporter of the "treat data as a product" movement.

## Side-Shows

Since one of my main personal treats is being lazy in combination with a deep hatred for repetitive tasks, i developed a natural interest in DevOps & automation. To make up for lack of concentration (and sleep...), i am usually not touching any code unless it's version controlled. That includes but is not limited to: cloud infrastructure (as code), database schemas, pipeline definitions, all kinds of scripts/notebooks and the grocery list for my next shopping tour.

As a result of the above, a topic that attracted my interest (and since then also became part of my professional portfolio) is the implementation/optimization of development & deployment workflows in data projects. Some of the tools/services that i have been using in that regard are:

- Azure DevOps: Repos, Boards, Pipelines, Artifacts
- Atlassian Cloud: Jira, Bitbucket, Confluence, Bamboo
- Github: Repos, Actions, Issues, Projects, Codespaces
- And the mother of them all: __Git__[^git]
- _Gitlab: soon to be added to this list_

Since __DevOps and automation__ usually require some sort of scripting, i am constantly trying to improve my Powershell, Python, Bash & Fish hacking skills.

Regarding __data manipulation & transformation__ i am most experienced in T-SQL, due to a strong SQL Server background. These days though, i mainly work with Python/Pyspark & Spark-SQL in (Jupyter or Databricks) notebooks, which is a lot of fun and a welcome change.

My first IT related job as a web developer (end of last century...) still benefits me to date! Having basic knowledge about HTTP and OAUTH (flows) can be really helpful when using or providing REST-APIs. Not my favorite topic in general, but like in real life (relationships): some things just need time to grow :grin:

In the past i also pretended to know a bit of: Lua, Tcl/Tk, VBA, Javascript, Actionscript and probably a few other languages which i forgot a long time ago.

## Professional Past

Some technologies, software providers and topics that i spent time with in my (professional) past are:

- SQL-Server (on-Premise): Relational-DB, SSIS, SSAS, SSRS.
- SAP: BW (Datamodeling, Processchains, Bex Queries, etc.), Business Objects (Analysis for Office, Lumira Designer, BI/BO Platform), ERP/R3 (mainly FI/CO/HCM/COPA), SEM-BCS (management consolidation).
- IBM Planning Analytics (aka TM1), Palo/Jedox and other _real_ OLAP engines & databases including all sorts of Excel integrations that usually come along with those.
- Classical Data Warehousing & Modeling.
- Corporate Performance Management (CPM): Main focus being financial, sales, project and product planning & forecasting.
- Financial Reporting: Implementation of financial reports for all kind of flavors and in different tools & frontends as well as supportive addins (like Graphomate). Also creation of notation concepts/standards for financial reporting (IBCS-like).
- As an inhouse consultant, i also spent quite some time in improving the collaboration toolset and processes in the central Controlling department (40 people spread over various locations, countries and languages). Which basically means that i played around a lot with: Microsoft Teams (plus Addins/Apps), Sharepoint (on-premise and online), Planner/ToDo, OneDrive, O365, ...).
- At the same time i also made some operational use of my educational/business background by conducting the monthly business consolidation (as well as providing financial reports) for over 100 legal entities in [Styria Media Group](https://www.styria.com).

## Education & Certifications

My educational background is a master's degree in "Management and International Business"[^mib] (yikes) and 35+ years of being a self-taught computer nerd. If you care about certifications (personally i don't), you can check my [Credly](https://www.credly.com/users/ttotter) or [MS-Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/thomastotter-5644/) pages and might find out that (besides the obvious data engineering certs) i am also not a complete stranger to agile methods.

However, my opinion towards certifications is best explained by this picture (borrowed from the great Martin Fowler[^mf]):

## Creed

Since i couldn't put my work ethics/beliefs to better words myself, i am _borrowing_ most of [Automattic's creed](https://automattic.com) here:

[THE AUTOMATTIC CREED](https://automattic.com/creed/)

- I will never stop learning.
- I won’t just work on things that are assigned to me.[^assig]
- I know there’s no such thing as a status quo.
- I will build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers.
- I will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague, and I’ll remember the days before I knew everything.
- I am more motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation.[^corny]
- I will communicate as much as possible, because it’s the oxygen of a distributed company.
- I am in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day.
- Given time, there is no problem that’s insurmountable.

And a personal addition:

- If i can't fix it, it was probably never broken in the first place :grin:
