## Me, myself and I
Hi there and welcome to my secret hideout[^1]!

I am Thomas and currently occupied as an (Azure) data engineer using mostly these tools/services at the moment:
- Synapse (Serverless, Dedicated, Spark, Data Explorer, Pipelines, ...)
- Data Factory
- Databricks
- SQL-Server(s) of any kind
- Storage accounts / Datalake(s)

I am more and more becoming a fan of lakehouse architectures including their key key components like delta-(live)-tables, delta-sharing, unity catalog and Datbricks/Synapse shared meta data (tables).

Since one of my my main treats is being lazy and hating repetitive tasks, i developed a natural interest in DevOps & automation. To make up for my lack of concentration (and missing sleep), i am usually not touching any code, unless it is version controlled. That includes cloud infrastructure, database schemas and any kind of scripts & notebooks.

So the next big topics turned out to be: 
- Azure DevOps (Repos, Boards, Pipelines, Artifacts, ...)
- Atlassian Cloud services (Jira, Bitbucket, Confluence, ...) and their integration
- Github (Actions, Issues, Projects, ...)
- Version control (Git) in general

Since automation requires some kind of scripting, i am constantly working on my Powershell, Bash/Fish and Ubuntu scripting skills. 

In the past i also pretended to know a bit of Lua, Tcl/Tk, VBA, Javascript, Actionscript and a few others, which i can't remember anymore.

Regarding transformation of data, i am most fluent in (T-)SQL, but also working on Python (Pyspark for that matter), Scala and other languages/dialects like Databricks-SQL, KQL (Kusto), etc.

## The past
Technologies and tools that i spent time on in my (professional) past:
- SQL-Server on-Premise (SSIS, SSAS, SSRS)
- SAP ERP (key user in FI/CO), BW (Datamodeling, Processchains, ...), Business Objects (Analysis for Office, Lumira Designer, Bex, ...)
- IBM Planning Analytics (TM1) and PALO
- CPM (Corporate Performance Management)
- Financial Report Design & Implementation (IBCS)

My educational background is a master's degree in "Management and International Business"[^2] (yikes) and 35+ years of being a self-taught computer nerd.

## Creed

Ok, i have to admit i am quite the copycat and borrowed the following from [here](https://automattic.com), but i can strongly identify myself with those words.

[THE AUTOMATTIC CREED](https://automattic.com/creed/)
- I will never stop learning.
- I won’t just work on things that are assigned to me.
- I know there’s no such thing as a status quo.
- I will build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers.
- I will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague, and I’ll remember the days before I knew everything.
- I am more motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation.
- I will communicate as much as possible, because it’s the oxygen of a distributed company.
- I am in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day.
- Given time, there is no problem that’s insurmountable.
