# Me, myself and I

Hi there and welcome to my secret hideout[^blog] :wave:

I am Thomas and currently occupied as an (Azure) data engineer at [Capgemini Austria](https://www.capgemini.com/at-de/).

## Hot Topics & Interests

Not very surprisingly, my main focus is on all things data. More specifically, that currently means:

- Databricks, Spark & Delta
- Delta Live Tables & Spark Structured Streaming
- Data Explorer/Kusto
- Fabric
- Azure Data Factory
- Cloud Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Bicep)

And not so currently, meaning in the recent past, i saw a lot of:

- Synapse (Serverless & Dedicated[^dedic])
- SQL-Server Warehouse(s)
- Restful APIs & GraphQL

After 18 years of classical data warehousing, i finally got to dive into the data lake (-house), which i won't leave anytime soon it seems.

Besides signing the [DataOps Manifesto](https://dataopsmanifesto.org/), i am also a supporter of the "treat data as a product" movement.

## Side-Shows

Since one of my main treats is laziness (when it comes to repetitive tasks), i developed a natural interest in DevOps & automation. And due to constant lack of sleep, I usually don't touch any code, unless it's version controlled. That includes but is not limited to: cloud infrastructure (as code), database schemas, pipeline definitions, all kinds of scripts, notebooks and the grocery list for my next shopping tour.

As a result of the above, i somehow stumbled into the beautiful world of DevOps (although that name was not a thing back then). My personal project lifecycle these days often goes looks like this: Getting hired as an architect/data enginner at first, but then silently turning into the dedicated DevOps and Git guy. Although it was never my intention, i think i got the DevOps bingo card full now:

- Azure DevOps (Repos, Boards, Pipelines, etc.)
- The Atlassian(s): Bitbucket, Jira, Confluence (and even Bamboo...).
- Github (my teenage love)
- Gitlab
- And if artefact registries also belong on this list: Cloudsmith

However, there can be only one god. And for me that is and always will be: __Git__[^git]. After using it for almost a decade, i still feel like i don't know half of it and am constantly amazed how limitless the possibilities of this genius piece of software really are.

## Scripting

Since __DevOps and automation__ usually require some sort of scripting, i found myself dealing with the usual (scripting) suspects: Powershell, Bash, Python (and for fun and good looks also: Fish).

Regarding __data manipulation & transformation__ i am most experienced in T-SQL, due to spending many years implementing SQL warehouses. Switching to Python felt a bit odd at first, but today there is no doubt it in my mind: The added value one gets (for free) from the whole Python software engineering eco-system (formatting, linting, automated testing, packaging, ...) cannot be missed out on. Implementing data projects in Python almost starts to feel like 'real' software development these days.

Also, a life without (Jupyter) notebooks might be possible, but makes absolutely no sense to me anymore :smirk:.

## Professional Past

Way back in time, i also worked a lot with (or in):

- SQL-Server (on-Premise): Relational-DBs, SSIS, SSAS, SSRS.
- SAP: BW (Datamodeling, Processchains, Bex Queries, etc.), Business Objects (Analysis for Office, Lumira Designer, BI/BO Platform), ERP/R3 (mainly FI/CO/HCM/COPA), SEM-BCS (management consolidation).
- IBM Planning Analytics (aka TM1), Palo/Jedox and other _real_ OLAP engines & databases including all sorts of Excel integrations that usually come along with those.
- Corporate Performance Management (CPM): Main focus was building financial, sales, project and product planning (& forecasting) solutions.
- Financial Reporting: Implemented a lot of financial reports in various tools and different kind of backends, including notation concepts (IBCS-like).
- As an inhouse consultant, i also spent quite some time in improving the collaboration toolset in a centralized Controlling department (40 people spread over various locations, countries and languages). Which basically means that i played around a lot with Microsoft Teams, Sharepoint (on-premise and online), Planner/ToDo, OneDrive, O365, etc.).
- At the same time i also made some operational use of my educational/business background by conducting the monthly business consolidation (as well as providing financial reports) for over 100 legal entities in a media group.

## Education & Certifications

My educational background is a master's degree in "Management and International Business"[^mib] (yikes) and 35+ years of being a self-taught computer nerd. If you care about certifications (personally, i don't), you can check my [Credly](https://credly.credly.ttotter.pw) or [MS-Learn](https://mslearn.totter.pw) pages and might find out that (besides the obvious data engineering certs) i am also not a complete stranger to agile methods.

However, my opinion towards certifications is best explained by this picture (borrowed from the great Martin Fowler[^mf]):

## Creed

Since i couldn't put my work ethics/beliefs to better words, i am _borrowing_ [Automattic's creed](https://automattic.com) here:

[THE AUTOMATTIC CREED](https://automattic.com/creed/)

- I will never stop learning.
- I won’t just work on things that are assigned to me.[^assig]
- I know there’s no such thing as a status quo.
- I will build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers.
- I will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague, and I’ll remember the days before I knew everything.
- I am more motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation.[^corny]
- I will communicate as much as possible, because it’s the oxygen of a distributed company.
- I am in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day.
- Given time, there is no problem that’s insurmountable.

And a personal addition:

- If i can't fix it, it was probably never broken in the first place :grin:
