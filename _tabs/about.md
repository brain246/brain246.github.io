# Me, myself and I

Hi there and welcome to my secret hideout[^blog] :wave:

I am Thomas and currently occupied as an (Azure) data engineer at [Braincourt (soon to be Capgemini)](https://www.braincourt.com).

## Current Interests

Some of my main interests right now are:
- Synapse (Serverless & dedicated SQL pools, Spark, Data Explorer aka Kusto, ...)
- Data Pipelines (Synapse & Data Factory)
- Databricks
- SQL-Servers (of any kind)
- Datalake(s)
- Streaming (data, not movies...)
- Restful APIs & GraphQL
- Cloud Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Bicep)

I am more and more becoming a fan of lakehouse architecture(s) and related topics like delta-lakes, delta-live-tables, pyspark notebooks and anything specific to Synapse and/or Databricks: shared meta data, delta-sharing, unity catalog, etc. 

Since one of my my main treats is being lazy in combination with a deep hatred for repetitive tasks, i developed a natural interest in DevOps & automation. To make up for the lack of concentration (and sleep...) on my part, i am usually not touching any code unless it is version controlled. That includes but is not limited to: cloud infrastructure (as code), database schemas, pipeline definitions, all kinds of scripts/notebooks and the grocery list for my next shopping tour.

As a result of the above, the next topic, that attracted my interest and has since then become a part of my professional portfolio, is the implementation of development & deployment workflows in data projects. Some of the tools & services that i have been utilizing in that regard are: 
- Azure DevOps: Repos, Boards, Pipelines, Artifacts
- Atlassian Cloud: Jira, Bitbucket, Confluence, Bamboo
- Github: Repos, Actions, Issues, Projects, Codespaces
- And the most important of all: Git[^git]

Since DevOps/automation usually requires some sort of scripting, i am constantly working on improving my Powershell, Bash/Unix/Fish and other (relevant) scripting skills. 

In the past i also pretended to know a bit of Lua, Tcl/Tk, VBA, Javascript, Actionscript and probably a few others that i can't remember right now. My motto in that regard is: If it's a scripting language, i can deal with it (sooner or later). 

Regarding data manipulation/transformation i am most experienced (by far) in T-SQL due to a strong SQL Server background.Although these days i mainly try to improve my skills in Python (Pyspark), Scala and other data-languages (Databricks-SQL, KQL/Kusto, ...).

I was kinda glad about having a little background in html&web-development when i realized, that providing (or at least using) REST-APIs belongs to the basic data engineer toolset these days. OAUTH & other authentication flows weren't my favorite thing at first, but like in real life relationships: some things just need time to grow :grin:

## The Past

Technologies & topics that i spent time on in my professional past:
- SQL-Server on-Premise: Relational-DB, SSIS, SSAS, SSRS.
- SAP BW (Datamodeling, Processchains, Bex Queries, etc.), Business Objects (Analysis for Office, Lumira Designer, BI/BO Platform), ERP/R3 (mainly FI/CO/HCM/COPA), SEM-BCS (used for monthly management consolidation).
- IBM Planning Analytics (aka TM1), Palo/Jedox and other **real** OLAP engines & databases including all sorts of Excel integrations that usually come along wih that.
- Corporate Performance Management (CPM): Main focus being financial, sales & product planning.
- Financial Reporting: Design, (notation) concept (IBCS) & implementation of financial reports in various frontends and supportive addins (like Graphomate).
- As inhouse consultant i also spent time improving the collaboration toolset in my department (Teams & Addins, Sharepoint on-Premise/Online, Planner/ToDo, OneDrive, etc.).
- Monthly business consolidation and group reporting of over 100 legal entities.

## Education & Certifications

My educational background is a master's degree in "Management and International Business"[^mib] (yikes) and 35+ years of being a self-taught computer nerd. If you care about certifications (personally i don't) you can check my [Credly](https://www.credly.com/users/ttotter) page and might find out that (besides the obvious data engineering stuff) i am also not a complete stranger to agile methods. 

My opinion towards certifications is best explained by this picture (borrowed from the great Martin Fowler[^mf]):

## Creed

I have to admit that i am quite the copycat and borrowed the following creed from [Automattic](https://automattic.com), but i haven't found any text yet, which i can identify myself more with than this:

[THE AUTOMATTIC CREED](https://automattic.com/creed/)
- I will never stop learning.
- I won’t just work on things that are assigned to me.
- I know there’s no such thing as a status quo.
- I will build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers.
- I will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague, and I’ll remember the days before I knew everything.
- I am more motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation.
- I will communicate as much as possible, because it’s the oxygen of a distributed company.
- I am in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day.
- Given time, there is no problem that’s insurmountable.

And my personal addition:
- If i can't fix it, it was probably never broken in the first place :grin:
