## Me, myself and I
Hi there and welcome to my blog![^1]

My name is Thomas and i am currently occupied as an Azure data engineer using any/all  these nifty tools:
- Synapse (Serverless, Dedicated, Spark, Data Explorer, Pipelines, ...)
- Data Factory
- Databricks
- SQL-Server(s) of any kind
- Datalake(s)

I am a fan of (data) lakehouse architecture including delta-tables and anything related.

Since one of my main treats is being lazy (and hating repetitive work), i naturally developed an interest in DevOps/Automation. To make up for lack of concentration (treat #2), i am not touching any code unless it is version controlled. That includes cloud infrastructure, database schemas as well as any kind of scripts.

This led to my little 'side-kick' implementing CI/CD/DevOps workflows in:
- Azure DevOps (Repos, Boards, Pipelines, Artifacts, ...)
- Atlassian Cloud (Jira, Bitbucket, Confluence, ...)
- Github (Actions, Issues, Projects, ...)

Some would say that Git isn't an interest of mine, but more of a religion to me :hindu_temple:

Since automation requires some scripting, i am constantly working on my Powershell, Bash (Fish) and other scripting skills. In the past i also pretended to know a bit of Lua, Tcl/Tk, VBA, Javascript, Actionscript and a few others i can't remember anymore.

Regarding querying and transformation of data i am most fluent in (T-)SQL, but also working on Python (Pyspark for that matter), Scala and other languages/dialects like Databricks-SQL, KQL (Kusto), etc.

## The past
Technologies and tools that i spent time on in my (professional) past:
- SQL-Server on-Premise (SSIS, SSAS, SSRS)
- SAP ERP (key user in FI/CO), BW (Datamodeling, Processchains, ...), Business Objects (Analysis for Office, Lumira Designer, Bex, ...)
- IBM Planning Analytics (TM1) and PALO
- CPM (Corporate Performance Management)
- Financial Report Design & Implementation (IBCS)

My educational background is a master's degree in "Management and International Business"[^2] (yikes) and 35+ years of being a self-taught computer nerd, starting with a Commodore 64 in 1986 :nerd_face:

## Creed
Ok, i have to admit i stole this from [automattic](https://automattic.com), but i can strongly identify myself with those words.

[THE AUTOMATTIC CREED](https://automattic.com/creed/)
- I will never stop learning.
- I won’t just work on things that are assigned to me.
- I know there’s no such thing as a status quo.
- I will build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers.
- I will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague, and I’ll remember the days before I knew everything.
- I am more motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation.
- I will communicate as much as possible, because it’s the oxygen of a distributed company.
- I am in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day.
- Given time, there is no problem that’s insurmountable.
